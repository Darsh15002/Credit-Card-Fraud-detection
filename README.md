# Credit-Card-Fraud-detection

# Project Overview

A credit card is a financial instrument made out of plastic issued by the banks. Credit card comes with a pre – set credit limit set by the banks depending on the persons earning allowing them to make cashless transactions. The Central bank of India had launched the first credit card in India in the year 1980.
In this modern era the risk of fraud lent transaction is increasing everyday. Top organizations, MNC’s and many individuals are getting trapped in fraud transactions. Today there are many efficient solutions developed that can predict Fraud Transactions that are happening.
In this project I have created a Credit card Fraud Detection system using Machine Learning Models and Algorithms using the credit card transaction data. This data is available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud . This dataset has 284807 rows and 31 columns. This dataset belongs to Supervised Machine Learning Model. Here I have used 4 different Machine Learning Models that are Isolation Random Forest Model (IFM), Local Outlier Factor Model (LOF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression Model to predict the Credit Card Fraud Detection in the dataset.

# Problem Highlighted
The Goal of this project is to accurately predict the fraud transactions in the dataset using Machine Learning models and algorithms. In this project I have used 4 Machine Learning Models namely as IFM, LOF, SVM and Logistic Regression and have displayed there accuracy score and classification report to highlight which model will be best for this case. 
While completing the Project I have learned the following things:

•	How to properly carry out the general Machine Learning Project Workflow.
•	The different techniques used in the process of Data Pre-processing.
•	How to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. 
•	How to use the Under-sampling method on a dataset with unequal distribution. 
•	How to apply different Machine Learning models and Algorithms on the same dataset
•	How to increase the Accuracy score of the model and extract classification report.
